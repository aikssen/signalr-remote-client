* This is an example of how to use signalR with CORS enabled.
* Also it doesn't have the autogenerated proxy file under `/signalr/hubs`
* It contains two different clients. One inside the same domain of the signalR server,
and the other outside in the `/signalR-client` folder. This example can be execute with `httpster`,
for instance.


### HTTPSTER
In order to test the standalone client use httpster or any other basic http server
```
(Requires Node.js 6+)

$ npm i -g httpster
$ cd /path/to/project/signalR-client/
$ httpster -p 3000

(Open http://localhost:3000)
```
